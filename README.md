## About

This repository is a project that i made for my statistics and probabilistic models class, it's a jupyter notebook that analysis two datasets about chromecast and smart-tv, and then the objective was to accomplish some questions about the datasets and the analysis made. The questions are in the project pdf file. The dataset used in this project is not disponible because it was a college report and it was big enough to upload to github.
